# E-Commerce-success
Analysis success of e-commerce websites by several KPI, with actionable insights results.

This project dives into the world of e-commerce, focusing specifically on the factors that contribute to the success of e-commerce websites. Success in the e-commerce industry is multi-dimensional and can be influenced by various factors. 

To quantify the success of e-commerce websites, I have chosen to focus on four key performance indicators: 
1. Customer retantion rate
2. Growth rate in revenue
3. Growth rate in number of sales
4. Customer acquistion rate

Each website ranked under those metrics to enable comprehensive view of performance, and allowing clear comparisons and identification of top performers.
