# E-Commerce-success
Analysis success of e-commerce websites by several KPI, with actionable insights results.
## Introduction
This project dives into the world of e-commerce, focusing specifically on the factors that contribute to the success of e-commerce websites. Success in the e-commerce industry is multi-dimensional and can be influenced by various factors. 

To quantify the success of e-commerce websites, I have chosen to focus on four key performance indicators: 
1. Customer retantion rate
2. Growth rate in revenue
3. Growth rate in number of sales
4. Customer acquistion rate

Each website ranked under those metrics to enable comprehensive view of performance, and allowing clear comparisons and identification of top performers.

## The data 
I got 2 seperate CSV files to work on in this project:

1. `Sites Data/`- All the fields about the sites information and their owners details including unique ID each site, the country it's based in, type, industry and the publish date.
1. `Sales Data/`- Table with all the transactions history of the websites including the unique ID for the site(foreign key), unique ID for the transaction, unique id for the customer, product name and price, date of transaction.

## Analysis Process
The analysis for the project was conducted in several stages:

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The raw data was cleaned and preprocessed using python and Excel. This included handling missing values, removing outliers, capitalize fixes, change variable type in order to improve efficiency and understand the big picture.
